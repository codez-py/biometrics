\section{Conclusion}
The model trained on 90° GEI’s perform better than other models. Using 3-channel GEI’s improve accuracy only at 90 degrees. 90° is the ideal angle to capture gait, but even for 72° gait sequence
the model gives accuracy around 90%.

\section{Future Scope}
This approach can be extended to perform different types of classification. This simple model achieves good accuracy for the binary classification task. Other complex models may be required to extract features in a multi class classification problem.
